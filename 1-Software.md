### [SubT Hello World](https://github.com/osrf/subt_hello_world)

A set of software and tutorials developed by DARPA and Open Robotics to quick start an autonomous virtual robot capable of exploring and finding artifacts.
Multiple open-source software repositories for mapping, object detection, and navigation are built into a dockerized solution.

### [Robot Body Filter](https://github.com/peci1/robot_body_filter) and its [Tutorial Using SubT Virtual Robots](https://github.com/ctu-vras/rosdevday_cloud_filtering)

Package with an advanced and highly configurable filter for pointclouds and laser scans which removes measurements on the body of the robot. It can be used both in simulation and on real robots. The tutorial ([software](https://github.com/ctu-vras/rosdevday_cloud_filtering), [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0ljV0uZy3Q)) has been made for ROSDevDay 2021 using the CTU-CRAS-NORLAB virtual SubT robots.
