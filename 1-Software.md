### [SubT Hello World](https://github.com/osrf/subt_hello_world)

A set of software and tutorials developed by DARPA and Open Robotics to quick start an autonomous virtual robot capable of exploring and finding artifacts.
Multiple open-source software repositories for mapping, object detection, and navigation are built into a dockerized solution.

### [Occupancy Homogeneous Map (ohm)](https://github.com/csiro-robotics/ohm)

GPU accelerated occupancy and voxel mapping with heightmap generation for high rate lidar by Team CSIRO Data61. Supports both OpenCL and/or CUDA for generating probabilistic occupancy maps with extended models such as normal distribution transforms. Additional modules support generation of single or multi-layer heightmaps with virtual surface generation for negative obstacle avoidance.
